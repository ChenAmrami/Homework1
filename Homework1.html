                </h2>
                <p>
                    Acaí is a 1-inch round berry that comes from the acai palm tree, which is native to
                    rainforests of Central and South America. The berries have a deep purple skin, yellow
                    flesh, and a large-sized seed inside. They're fairly similar to grapes in their size
                    and structure—the seed takes up about 80 percent of the fruit itself. Acaí berries have
                    a slightly sweet and earthy flavor that's often compared to blueberries paired with very
                    dark chocolate.

                    History
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The açaí berry began to make its way to the masses of Brazil in the 1970s as local 
                    migrations of indigenous people prompted the fruit to gain popularity further and 
                    further away from the Amazon River delta. But at this point, the fruit was still being 
                    eaten in traditional forms. So where did the smoothie bowl originate? For that, we have 
                    legendary coach and founder of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Carlos Gracie, to thank. After 
                    realizing the tremendous health benefits of the fruit (and low sugar content), Gracie 
                    included an açaí and banana blend as a staple in his recommended nutrition plan 
                    (The Gracie Diet) for his athletes.

                    May Improve Heart Health:
                    Açai is high in nutrients and plant compounds that may benefit heart health in several ways. 
                    May Benefit People with Prostate Cancer:
                    Açaí is a concentrated source of plant compounds like anthocyanins that are known for 
                    their anticancer properties.3 Although more research is needed, some studies show açaí 
                    berries may be helpful for people with prostate cancer.
